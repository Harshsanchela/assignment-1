1) What is CSS? How does it differ from HTML?
  - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of a web page, 
    including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. It allows developers to separate the structure
    and content of a webpage (defined by HTML) from its visual appearance, making it easier to maintain and update the design.​

  - Difference between HTML and CSS 
    Purpose: HTML is used to structure content on the web, while CSS is used to style and layout that content.
    Syntax: HTML uses tags to define elements, while CSS uses selectors and rules to style those elements.
    Functionality: HTML provides the basic structure and content of a web page, while CSS enhances its visual appearance.
    Separation of Concerns: HTML and CSS are separate languages that work together to build a web page, allowing for greater flexibility and easier maintenance.
    Browser Support: Both HTML and CSS are supported by all modern browsers, ensuring that web pages will display consistently across devices.
    Versions: HTML has gone through several versions, with the latest being HTML5, while CSS has three levels of specification: CSS1, CSS2, and CSS3.
    Dynamic content: While HTML is used to create static web pages, CSS can be used to create dynamic and interactive effects, such as hover effects and animations.
    Interactivity: HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page, while CSS and JavaScript are used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.

2) Explain the three ways to apply CSS to a web page..?
  - CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, 
    use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, 
    we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that 
    separates our CSS from our HTML.
  
  - <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">
    This paragraph is styled inline.</p>
  
  -     <head>
        <style>
            body { background-color: lightblue; }
            h1 { color: navy; }
        </style>
    </head>
    ``` [9].
*   **Usage:** Suitable for styling a single HTML page with a unique style, 
    or for applying styles to multiple elements within that specific page [1, 2].

**3. External CSS:**

*   **Definition:** External CSS involves creating a separate `.css` file that contains
   all style rules and linking it to the HTML document using a `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section [1, 2].
*   **Example:**
    ```html
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    </head>


3) What are CSS selectors? List and describe the different types of selectors.?
  - CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements on your pages, allowing you to apply 
    styles based on their ID, class, type attributes, and more. 
    There are mainly 5 types of selectors.
  - Basic CSS Selectors: These are used to target elements by tag, 
    .class, or #id for fundamental styling needs.
  - Combinators: Ideal for styling elements based on their DOM relationships 
    (e.g., parent-child or sibling relationships).
  - Group Selectors: Use to apply the same styles to multiple, 
    unrelated elements simultaneously.
  - Attribute Selectors: Perfect for styling elements based on specific attributes 
    or values, such as form inputs or links with certain prefixes or states.
  - Pseudo-Classes: Best for styling elements dynamically or interactively, 
    like :hover for user interaction or :nth-child() for structural styling.


4) What is the box model in CSS? Explain its components..?
  - The CSS box model treats every HTML element as a rectangular box, which can be manipulated and positioned using CSS properties.
    The box model has four main components: content, padding, border, and margin. 
    These components work together to define the size and layout of an element on a webpage.

  - Content: The area where text or other content is displayed.
    Padding: Space between the content and the element’s border.
    Border: A frame that wraps around the padding and content.
    Margin: Space between the element’s border and neighbouring elements.
