1) What is HTML? Explain its structure...?
  -  HyperText Markup Language,
  -  the foundational language for web pages.
     It uses elements, tags, and attributes to structure content,
     defining how text, images, links, and other elements are displayed in a web browser. 
     The basic structure includes a DOCTYPE declaration, 
     an <html> root element containing a <head>
     for metadata and a <body> for the visible content.


2) Describe the purpose of HTML tags and provide examples of commonly used tags..?
  - HTML tags are the foundation of web page structure, telling browsers how to display content. 
    They act as instructions,defining elements like headings,paragraphs, images, and links. 
    Commonly used tags include <html> (root element), <head> (document metadata), <body> (visible content), 
    <h1>-<h6> (headings), <p> (paragraph), <a> (link),<img> (image), and <ul>/<li>/<a> (lists).

3) What are the differences between block-level and inline elements? Give examples of each...?
  - Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full available width, 
    while inline elements flow within a line and only take up as much space as their content requires. 
    Examples of block elements include <p> (paragraph), <div> (division), 
    and <h1> (heading), whereas examples of inline elements include <span>,
    <a> (link), and <img> (image). 

4) Explain the concept of semantic HTML and why it is important...?
  - Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that accurately describe the meaning and structure of web page content, 
    rather than just defining its presentation. This approach makes web pages more accessible,
    understandable for both humans and machines (like search engines and screen readers), and more maintainable.
